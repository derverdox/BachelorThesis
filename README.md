# Blockchain and Games: Evaluating Practicality and Impact

This thesis discusses the practicality and impact of blockchain technologies on game development.
Due to the increasingly popular topic of blockchain, so-called blockchain games have been published in the past.
This raises the question of whether using this technology as a foundation for games is a valid design choice.
In order to understand the arguments, a theoretical basis must first be created. 
To achieve this, we first summarize the historical background of blockchain technology and the development of Bitcoin to understand why it exists and what it is used for. 
After looking closer at the Bitcoin blockchain implementation, we introduce Ethereum and its smart contract capabilities, which are needed to write simple Turing-complete programs that the Ethereum Virtual Machine can execute.
In addition, examples of smart contracts and their usage in the Unity game engine are presented.
The evaluation chapter of this thesis then discusses various arguments for and against blockchain as a tool in software and especially game development.
By reading this work, the reader will gain a deeper understanding of blockchain technology and thus be able to follow and evaluate the arguments in this ongoing discussion.
