abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increase in the interest in non-fungible tokens (NFT) to purchase digital art and has shaped a new form of art collecting. The art community has a long history of challenges and opportunities with the commercialization of art. More recently, there has also been an interest in the purchase of game art as investments or collecting. With the advent of blockchain currencies, NFTs have introduced a way for investors, collectors, and game developers to purchase or sell game art. However, the potential of NFT for the games and game development industry is manifold. In this paper, the authors will reflect on the potential of NTF’s for game developers and content creators.},

abstract={Since the appearance of public-key cryptography in the seminal Diffie---Hellman paper, many new schemes have been proposed and many have been broken. Thus, the simple fact that a cryptographic algorithm withstands cryptanalytic attacks for several years is often considered as a kind of validation procedure. A much more convincing line of research has tried to provide ``provable'' security for cryptographic protocols. Unfortunately, in many cases, provable security is at the cost of a considerable loss in terms of efficiency. Another way to achieve some kind of provable security is to identify concrete cryptographic objects, such as hash functions, with ideal random objects and to use arguments from relativized complexity theory. The model underlying this approach is often called the ``random oracle model.'' We use the word ``arguments'' for security results proved in this model. As usual, these arguments are relative to well-established hard algorithmic problems such as factorization or the discrete logarithm.},

abstract="Large-scale peer-to-peer systems face security threats from faulty or hostile remote computing elements. To resist these threats, many such systems employ redundancy. However, if a single faulty entity can present multiple identities, it can control a substantial fraction of the system, thereby undermining this redundancy. One approach to preventing these ``Sybil attacks'' is to have a trusted agency certify identities. This paper shows that, without a logically centralized authority, Sybil attacks are always possible except under extreme and unrealistic assumptions of resource parity and coordination among entities.",

Next, the enabling technologies that made blockchain possible are briefly discussed. Finally, a simple technical explanation is given of how this technology works.

As far as we know, the first attempt was made by the Renaissance architect Leon Battista Alberti (1404--1472), who positioned one concentric disk on top of another, each one inscribed with all the letters of the alphabet. By turning one disk to a certain position with respect to the other, he was able to pair each letter with another, which served to automate the task of encrypting messages by substituting letters. The device may only have mechanically reproduced actions that could be done mentally, but it did ensure that no substitution errors were made in the process.",

The objective of this article is to demonstrate the limits of scarcity in value construction for owners of CryptoKitties tokens, manifested as breedable virtual cats. Our work extends the trends set out by earlier cryptocurrency studies from the perspective of cultural studies. For the purpose of this article, we rely on open blockchain analytics such as DappRadar and Etherscan, as well as player-created analytics, backed by a one-year-long participant observation period in the said game for research material. Combining theoretical cryptocurrency and Bitcoin studies, open data analysis, and virtual ethnography enables a grounded discussion on blockchain-based game design and play. }

ABSTRACT = {Scarce and niche in the literature just a few years ago, the blockchain topic is now the main subject in conference papers and books. However, the hype generated by the technology and its potential implications for real-world applications is flawed by many misconceptions about how it works and how it is implemented, creating faulty thinking or overly optimistic expectations. Too often, characteristics such as immutability, transparency, and censorship resistance, which mainly belong to the bitcoin blockchain, are sought in regular blockchains, whose potential is barely comparable. Furthermore, critical aspects such as oracles and their role in smart contracts receive few literature contributions, leaving results and theoretical implications highly questionable. This literature review of the latest papers in the field aims to give clarity to the blockchain oracle problem by discussing its effects in some of the most promising real-world applications. The analysis supports the view that the more trusted a system is, the less the oracle problem impacts.},

abstract = {Two approaches to the study of program testing are described. One approach is theoretical and the other empirical. In the theoretical approach situations are characterized in which it is possible to use testing to formally prove the correctness of programs or the correctness of properties of programs. In the empirical approach statistics are collected which record the frequency with which different testing strategies reveal the errors in a collection of programs. A summary of the results of two research projects which investigated these approaches are presented. The differences between the two approaches are discussed and their relative advantages and disadvantages are compared.},
